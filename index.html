<center><h1>The Interwebs</h1></center>
<b>How it works</b>
<p>People with computers download browsers; browsers, using HTTP, 
send out queries and return webpages page plucked from 
super-space-saving filing-cabinet computers called servers...
hidden in air conditioned closets. 

<br><br>These pages are usually formatted using HTML, 
<b>hypertext markup language</b>, and can contain 
<em>almost anything</em>: 
text, images, videos, links, pdf's, multiple levels.  
The browser reads the text, markup and 
references to turn the information into something 
user-friendly.
</p>

<h2>Elements</h2>
<p>
Elements are used in markup, which controls how a webpage, and 
its content, look.  Elements consist, usually, of an opening tag, 
content, and a closing tag. Some elements, called void tags, 
don't need closing tags. 
<center> Line break: {br} <br>
and the image element: {img  src="url" alt="text"}
<br>
are two examples of void tags
<br><br>
Bold, and/or Strong: {b}text{/b}, {strong}text{/strong}<br>
need closing tags

</center></p>

Elements can be either inline or block.  Inline elements create
no additional space around them and can "butt" right up against
text.  Block elements create a box in which their content resides.

<center>
  Line break {br} is inline, but paragraph {p}{/p}<p>is block text</p>
  and created the space preceeding and following the above line. 
</center>
<br>
But both are necessary to manage the "white space" on an HTML page, 
since spaces and carriage returns are rendered null when a browser
reads HTML. Multiple spaces and any carriage returns are turned into
a single space.  Space, therefore, has to be deliberately coded in.

<h3>Attributes, span/div</h3>
Attributes modify their elements, or are properties of elements. Span 
and Div, for instance, can have attributes added to them.  Both elements
contain text, Span is inline and Div is block.  Neither are void tags.  
Div behaves much like the paragraph tag, but doesn't create as much space
  around it.
